For those struggling with the syncing of the dependencies: If you are using the new androidx libraries instead of regular android,
you need to use the dependencies I have outlined below (in the build gradle app) instead of the ones shown in this video:
implementation 'androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview-selection:1.0.0'
implementation 'androidx.cardview:cardview:1.0.0'
